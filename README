imgUploader provides enhancements to upload image to mediawiki article directly by drag&drop

# This extension requires MediaWiki 1.32 or higher (can not justify this).

For installation, once the code is copied into your extensions directory, you can load it for your
wiki by adding to LocalSettings.php the line:
wfLoadExtension('imgUpload');
	
Additions in LocalSettings.php
//enable uploads
$wgEnableUploads = true;
//allow upload files to anyone (for tests only)
$wgGroupPermissions['*']['upload'] = true;
//allow images filetypes
$wgFileExtensions = array('png', 'gif', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'tiff', 'bmp');

Commentaries:
- Based on https://github.com/Rovak/InlineAttachment
- Multiple images upload not tested
- Working with default editor and WikiEditor extension
- Not working with WYSIWYG extension (WYSIWYG using CKEditor functionality for this)
- Do not forget disable SELinux. Else you will catch exception like "LocalFileLockError" (or work with SELinux by youself)
- Errors and warnings messages will appear in text editor body
